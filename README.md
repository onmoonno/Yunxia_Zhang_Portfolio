# Data Science Projects

# [Project 1: Glucose Levels in Artificial Pancreas](https://github.com/onmoonno/Data-Mining-Project-Glucose-Levels-in-Artificial-Pancreas) 
* Developed a recognition system integrating supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for analyzing time series data from two asynchronously operated Medtronic 670G systems collected at 5-minute intervals over a 7-day period.
* Implemented adaptive data cleaning and extracted features, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Entropy calculations, as well as time span, from the time series dataset.
* Distinguished meal and no meal time series data through the training and testing of machine models, employing sklearn k-fold cross-validation for robust model training.
* Trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree Machine (DT), achieving a noteworthy DT F1-score of 77% and an Accuracy of 81%. Extracted ground truth and performed clustering using DBSCAN and Kmeans, attaining minimal DBSCAN entropy of 0.22 and maximum DBSCAN purity of 0.83.
