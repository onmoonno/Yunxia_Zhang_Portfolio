# [Project 3: Multi-Step Mars Visit Application MERN]([https://github.com/onmoonno/Local-Class](https://github.com/onmoonno/Mars-Visit-Application)) 

![Demo](https://github.com/onmoonno/Mars-Visit-Application/blob/main/frontend/public/Mar%20Visit%20App%20Demo.gif)
This project is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application is designed to handle multi-step form submissions with validation and data persistence. The data is collected from users and stored in a MongoDB database via the backend API. The form includes personal information, travel preferences, and health and safety details.

- **Multi-step Form:** A step-based form process to collect user information.
- **Form Validation:** Validates form data for required fields, email and phone formats, date consistency, and other custom rules.
- **Data Persistence:** Stores user submissions in a MongoDB database.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with React-Bootstrap for a mobile-friendly UI.
- **API Integration:** Connects the frontend to the backend API for data submission and retrieval.
