# [Project 2: Critical Factors of US Individual Salary](https://github.com/onmoonno/Critical-Factors-of-US-Individual-Salary) 
The primary goal of this project was to provide data-driven insights for the UVW marketing team to help them better understand their target market and support them in making informed decisions. Various exploratory data analysis methods were used to analyze the relationship between variables and locate the critical factors affecting individual salaries.

# Data Science Projects

# [Project 1: Glucose Levels in Artificial Pancreas](https://github.com/onmoonno/Data-Mining-Project-Glucose-Levels-in-Artificial-Pancreas) 
* Developed a recognition system integrating supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques for analyzing time series data from two asynchronously operated Medtronic 670G systems collected at 5-minute intervals over a 7-day period.
* Implemented adaptive data cleaning and extracted features, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Entropy calculations, as well as time span, from the time series dataset.
* Distinguished meal and no meal time series data through the training and testing of machine models, employing sklearn k-fold cross-validation for robust model training.
* Trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree Machine (DT), achieving a noteworthy DT F1-score of 77% and an Accuracy of 81%. Extracted ground truth and performed clustering using DBSCAN and Kmeans, attaining minimal DBSCAN entropy of 0.22 and maximum DBSCAN purity of 0.83.
